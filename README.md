# Hot Reloading for PHP

This is a simple package that will allow you to live reload a script that would stay alive via a cli command. For example, if you have a infinite while loop running in a script and do not want to stop and restart every time you make a change, this package will work well for you.

# Installing

This is yet to be a package for composer, but will be coming soon.
